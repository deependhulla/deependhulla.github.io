<h3 class="wp-block-heading">OpenSync: The Android App for Syncing Contacts and Calendars</h3>
<p>On Google Play :&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;id=com.deependhulla.opensync&amp;noprocess">Open Sync</a>&nbsp;100k+ Download</p>
<p>OpenSync [Apr 2017] :: Are you in search of a powerful tool to synchronize your contacts and calendars on your Android device? Look no further than OpenSync! As an open-source CalDAV/CardDAV sync app, OpenSync has been specifically designed and tested to seamlessly integrate with the Nextcloud Server. What&#8217;s more, it effortlessly integrates natively into your Android calendar and contact apps, making it a breeze to manage your important information.</p>
<p>OpenSync originated as a fork from the renowned open-source project&nbsp;<a href="https://davdroid.bitfire.at/source/">DavDroid</a>, which has now evolved into&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/bitfireAT/davx5-ose">DAVx5</a>. OpenSync itself was built upon DavDroid Version 1.5.0.3-ose, ensuring a solid foundation for reliable syncing.It is licensed under the GPLv3, just like DavDroid.</p>
<p>OpenSync is my personal endeavor to develop an Android app for CalDAV/CardDAV specifically tailored for Nextcloud, the server I use. While it is currently in the beta stage with some basic modifications from the original DavDroid code, Please note that OpenSync is not intended to replace the original DavDroid app or compete with it; rather, it offers an alternative option for users who appreciate its unique features.</p>
<p>If you find OpenSync to be a valuable addition to your Android experience, I encourage you to support the development of DAVdroid (the original app). Consider making a donation to DAVdroid, now known as&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bitfire.davdroid&amp;hl=en&amp;noprocess">DAVx5</a>, or purchasing it from the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>In the development of OpenSync, certain components have been outsourced into separate libraries, all based on the original DavDroid project. These include: *&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/bitfireAT/cert4android">cert4android</a>&nbsp;custom certificate management *&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/bitfireAT/dav4android">dav4android</a>&nbsp;WebDAV/CalDav/CardDAV framework *&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/bitfireAT/ical4android">ical4android</a>&nbsp;iCalendar processing and Calendar Provider access *&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/bitfireAT/vcard4android">vcard4android</a>&nbsp;VCard processing and Contacts Provider access</p>
<p>To further enhance OpenSync&#8217;s functionality, several third-party libraries have been utilized, building upon the foundations laid by the original DavDroid project. These libraries include: *&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbill.org/dnsjava/">dnsjava</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbill.org/dnsjava/dnsjava-current/LICENSE">BSD License</a>&nbsp;*&nbsp;<a href="https://code.google.com/p/ez-vcard/">ez-vcard</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">New BSD License</a>&nbsp;*&nbsp;<a href="http://ical4j.sourceforge.net/">iCal4j</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/ical4j/ical4j/ci/default/tree/LICENSE">New BSD License</a>&nbsp;*&nbsp;<a href="https://square.github.io/okhttp/">okhttp</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://square.github.io/okhttp/#license">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>&nbsp;*&nbsp;<a href="http://projectlombok.org/">Project Lombok</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT License</a></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">CloudDrive: Your Seamless Storage Solution</h3>
<p>On Google Play :&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;id=com.deependhulla.clouddrive&amp;noprocess">CloudDrive</a>&nbsp;500k+ Download</p>
<p>CloudDrive [Apr 2017] is an open-source WebDav client and cloud storage syncing application designed to handle all your data. With CloudDrive, you can effortlessly access and share documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, photos, and videos directly from your Android device. This app has been extensively tested with NextCloud Server and offers support for instant uploads of photos and videos taken with your device. Additionally, it provides offline storage capabilities for your files.</p>
<p>CloudDrive is a fork of the open-source NextCloud Android App, specifically version 1.4.2, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/android">https://github.com/nextcloud/android</a>. You can find the source code for CloudDrive at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/deependhulla/clouddrive">https://github.com/deependhulla/clouddrive</a>, and it is licensed under the GPLv2 License, just like the NextCloud Android App.</p>
<p>Please note that CloudDrive is currently in beta, and I have made some basic modifications to the original NextCloud Android App code. I intend to invest more time in enhancing this app in the future. However, it&#8217;s important to clarify that CloudDrive is not intended to replace the original NextCloud app or compete with it.</p>
<p>The primary motivation behind forking the NextCloud Android App was to address a discrepancy that many of my users experienced. While promoting Nextcloud&#8217;s open-source server, which offers comprehensive desktop and browser features, they found that the NextCloud Android App lacked these same functionalities. This discrepancy caused frustration among users who expected the same level of functionality in the app as in the browser version. Although NextCloud&#8217;s browser-based version performs well on mobile devices, it ultimately falls short of providing a native app experience. Upon realizing that the NextCloud Android App focused solely on file storage and drive features (at least for now, as NextCloud might have future plans), I decided to retain the same code base and rebrand it as CloudDrive, emphasizing its purpose as a NextCloud storage access app. This way, users will associate CloudDrive exclusively with storage functionality and not expect other features beyond that.</p>
